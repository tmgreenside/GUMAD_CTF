<h1>Welcome to the Spokane Mayor's Cyber Cup 2019!</h1>
<p>We at Gonzaga University's Makers and Developers (GU MAD) club are super hyped
that you are interested in computer security and
contributing to a learning environment that will benefit us all. It gives
us great pleasure to be hosting this event! We've prepared a variety of challenges,
including an attack-and-defend competition and Hacker's Jeopardy.</p>

<p>To register, please go <a href="/Registration">here</a> and add your team. You
    may register with up to three members, or five if two of your team members
    are underclassmen.</p>

<h2> Preparation </h2>
 It would be wise to be familar with the following technologies when competing:
 <li>
	<li>SSH: Teams will connect to administrate the servers using SSH and log into wargame challenges.</li>
	<li> Linux: The attack/defend boxes will be running a Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Teams should be familar with these basic principles:
	<li> Basic directory navigation </li>
	<li> Command line text editor (vim, emacs, nano, etc.) Only takes a few minutes to pick one of these classic text editors up! </li> </li>
	<li> Passion to learn: The most important skill to have! </li>
 </li>

 <p>These skills would be nice...But, do not panic! This is suppossed to be a learning experience for everyone involved! You are not expected to know these going in.</p>
