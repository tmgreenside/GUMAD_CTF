<h1>Rules and Regulations</h1>

<p>Please read the following, and then go <a href="/Registration/Register">here</a> to register your team. We're excited to have you!</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Gonzaga University School of Engineering and Applied Science.</li>
    <li>Teams of 1-3. If there are two freshman on the team, then a team is allowed
        5 members. Freshman are highly encouraged because we want them to come and learn!</li>
    <li>Slack channel for teams to communicate.</li>
    <li>Time estimate: 5 hours. </li>
    <li>There are two types of challenges. Read on!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Should be a fun and learning atomsphere.</li>
    <li>People should be helpful! Judges would <b>love to help you!</b></li>
</ul>

<h3> 
    Rules
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>No external, automated tools besides nmap (I'm talking about using Kali and
        other things). We believe that you are a smart and capable human being! Using google for answers/help is completely fine though.</li>
        <li>No DOS attacks on machines.</li>
        <li>Do not attack the scoreboard site.</li>
        <li>Hints are allowed by the people around. However, points will be taken off for this. Want the opportunity for people to have fun and solve challenges on their own first!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Attack/Defense:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This will consist of defending your own applications, while trying to exploit others.</li>
    <li>Teams need to keep your service up and running! Points are taken away for down time.</li>
    <li>Flags will rotate on 'ticks', where flags can be reclaimed.</li>
    <li>4 challenges total</li>
    <li>Defensively, if a malicious payload is seen, then report this to the officials for extra points, with a cap of 4 on this.</li>
    <li>Harden the system, not about hardening the flag. If your team is caught hardening the flag, you will be hit with major deduction.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Wargame and Jeopardy</h3>
<h5>Scoring</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Solving a wargame will give x number of points, depending on the difficulty and effort needed
        to solve the challenge.</li>
    <li>For the wargames, sending in write ups of mitigation reports will be extra points, if correct.</li>
    <li>A few of the wargames will be very hard to automate. So, people (known as judges) will manually have to look at them. This includes the XSS challenge, "I'm in" moment mitgiations and more.</li>

</ul>
