<h1>Rules and Regulations</h1>

<p>Please read the following, and then go <a href="/Registration/Register">here</a> to register your team. We're excited to have you!</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Gonzaga University School of Engineering and Applied Science.</li>
    <li>Teams of 1-3. If there are two freshman on the team, then a team is allowed
        5 members. Freshman are highly encouraged because we want them to come and learn!</li>
    <li>Slack channel for teams to communicate.</li>
    <li>Time estimate: 5 hours. </li>
    <li>There are two types of challenges. Read on!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Should be a fun and learning atmosphere.</li>
    <li>People should be helpful! Judges would <b>love to help you!</b></li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Rules
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>No external, automated tools besides nmap (I'm talking about using Kali and
        other things). We believe that you are a smart and capable human being! Using google for answers/help is completely fine though.</li>
        <li>No DOS attacks on machines.</li>
        <li>Do not attack the scoreboard site.</li>
        <li>Hints are allowed by the people around. However, points will be taken off for this. Want the opportunity for people to have fun and solve challenges on their own first!</li>
        <li>None of the challenges are BRUTE FORCE. So, do not try to brute force a flag.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Attack/Defense:</h3>
<p>Each team will be assigned a server with multiple <b>services</b> designed specifically  insecure for the contest. The exploitation of these services can lead hackers to do malicious things on the server. The goal is to patch(fix) your own services while exploiting the other teams applications. Teams will have complete access to the complete source code, as well as documentation on the service. Furthermore, startup, shutdown and reset scripts will be provided. At the start of the contest, every team will have the exact same services, with the same vulnerabilities present. </p>

<p>
    These services will be released once per hour at the beginning of the second hour of the contest.
</p>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
There are three main ways of scoring:
<ul>
    <li>
        Submitting stolen flags to the scoreboard website.
    </li>
    <li>
        Keeping services online and functional.
    </li>
    <li>
        Submitting 'blue team' reports, or defensive reports. If you believe you have a malicious request being made on your application, then you can submit it for points (limit 2 per service).
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    All of the flags will be in the form flag flag{15_alphabetic_characters}. Also, all of the flags will be in the <b>'/etc/service_A'</b>,<b>'/etc/service_B'</b>, <b>'/etc/service_C'</b>,<b>'/etc/service_D'</b> directories depending on the service. Furthermore, if an exploit is found that does not give off a flag (such as getting admin on a website) then the flag may appear.
</p>

<h3>Rounds</h3>
<p>
    The contest will have 6 one-hour rounds, with one flag associated with each service. At the beginning of each round all services will be issued new flags. So, this will give teams the opportunity to exploit the service once again.
</p>


<h3>Wargame and Jeopardy</h3>
<p>
    In jeopardy there are several categories where you pick a question, then attempt to answer it. The same goes with jeopardy CTF, with the only difference being that the questions are  challenges of some kind, where the answer is the flag. The current categories are Software(Web/Native),  Log Analysis/Steganography, Cryptography, Social Engineering and Miscellaneous.
</p>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Solving a wargame will give x number of points, depending on the difficulty and effort needed
        to solve the challenge.</li>
    <li>
        A few of the wargames will be very hard to automate. So, people (known as judges) will manually have to look at them. This includes the XSS challenge and a few others. 
    </li>
    <li>
        To receive the points, go to the challenge turn-in and submit the flag.
    </li>

</ul>
